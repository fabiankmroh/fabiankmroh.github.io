## 20240509: Conversion to Personal Blog
I had two platforms where I journaled my thoughts. 
- WordPress: ~ High School
    - First website platform taught from middle school --> Most familiar with it
    - Didn't like how the platform environment, particularly the user pool, isn't dedicated to journalism 
- Medium: ~ Now
    - Satisfied 100%

However, as much as I am being dedicated to my **daily commits**, I would like the record of my personal thoughts to be incorporated into the commit chain. 

Therefore, I would like to start creating my own website from top to bottom where I can express myself not only in content facet but also in web design facet.
